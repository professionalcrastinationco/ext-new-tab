At Preline UI, accessibility is a first-class priority and all components comes with built-in accessibility features. Our goal is to ensure that all users, regardless of ability, can interact with and benefit from our components and plugins. The `HSAccessibilityObserver` is a centralized accessibility management system that provides comprehensive keyboard navigation and interaction support for UI components. It acts as a global event coordinator that manages accessibility behaviors across all registered components in your application.
